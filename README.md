# **AICTE-Internship-P1-Image-Classification-by-Machine-Learning**  

## **Implementation-of-ML-Model-for-Image-Classification**  

This project is a **Streamlit application** designed for image classification using three powerful models: **MobileNetV2**, **CIFAR-10**, and **Xception**. Users can upload images and receive predictions with confidence scores from any of these models. Featuring a sleek navigation bar and real-time results, the app serves as an excellent tool for both educational and practical purposes.

## **Key Features**  

### **1. Triple Model Support**  
- **MobileNetV2 (ImageNet)**:  
  Recognizes 1,000 diverse classes, including objects, animals, and vehicles.  
- **Custom CIFAR-10 Model**:  
  Specializes in classifying images into 10 categories such as airplanes, automobiles, and birds.  
- **Xception Model**:  
  A state-of-the-art deep learning model leveraging extreme inception modules for highly accurate classification.  

### **2. Intuitive Interface**  
- **Navigation Bar**:  
  Effortlessly switch between models using the sidebar menu.  
- **Real-Time Classification**:  
  Upload an image and receive immediate predictions along with confidence scores.  

### **3. Educational and Practical Use**  
- Gain insights into how different deep learning models perform.  
- Applicable for real-world scenarios requiring image classification.
